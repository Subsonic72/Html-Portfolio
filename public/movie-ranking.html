<h1>The best movies according to Henry</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Robine Hood (the old one) </h3>
<p>This is one of the earliest movies in color. <br />
Yet, it manages to depict the story in a captivating way<br />
while also having some impressive stunts. Best of all, it does <br />
not really feel like a movie
</p>
<h3>Star wars ep.1</h3>
<p>Not much to say here, I like the fights in the movie and the<br />
fun atmosphere
</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious (the whole series)</h3>
<p>The movies are about strong, masculine men, fast cars and hot girls<br />
What is there not to like about it.
